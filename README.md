​	We have been looking at how food and nutritional data have been impacted in recent times. The landscape of the modern American diet has changed pretty dramatically in recent times. We aim to look at the food landscape as a whole and answer some pertinent questions about the current nutritional landscape in America. 

​	Overarching Question: “Does the proximity that people have to grocery stores affect what Americans have been eating?

​	Food Desert Data **(James & Mahesh)**:		

​	“Does proximity to a grocery store affect how much people are eating?”		

​	“On a per state basis, how far away from the average American from a grocery store.”	

​	US BEA(Bureau of Economic Analysis) Consumer Spending Data **(Lashonda)**:

​	“On a per state basis, how much are Americans spending on food at home out of their budgets?” “Based on the proximity data, does there seem to be any correlation between states with a longer distance between the average american and their closest grocery store, and how much of their budget they are spending on food?”
​	

​	USDA(United States Department of Agriculture) Food Expenditure Series **(Darian)**:

​	“What kinds of foods do Americans who eat at home seem to be spending money on, on a national level?”“Based on that information, are there any conclusions we can draw about food proximity of the average american and what kinds of foods we consume?	

​	Conclusion Question/Statement:	

​	“Based on our research it would seem that food deserts do/don’t majorly affect the food landscape of America. Our research indicated that proximity to grocery stores does/doesn’t affect the amount Americans spend on their groceries, and that it does/doesn’t seem to have an affect on what kinds of foods we are eating (ie. foods commonly associated with more home cooking vs foods more commonly associated with eating out, typically higher end food)”
